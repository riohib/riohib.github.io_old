  title={Uncovering the latent dynamics of whole-brain fMRI tasks with a sequential variational autoencoder},
  author={Eloy Geenjaar and Donghyun Kim and Riyasat Ohib and Marlena Duda and Amrit Kashyap and Sergey M Plis and Vince Calhoun},
  abstract={The neural dynamics underlying brain activity are critical to understanding cognitive processes and
   mental disorders. However, current voxel-based whole-brain dimensionality reduction techniques fail to capture
    these dynamics, producing latent timeseries that inadequately relate to behavioral tasks. To address this
     issue, we introduce a novel approach to learning low-dimensional approximations of neural dynamics using
      a sequential variational autoencoder (SVAE) that learns the latent dynamical system. Importantly, our 
      method finds smooth dynamics that can predict cognitive processes with accuracy higher than classical methods,
       with improved spatial localization to task-relevant brain regions, and we find fixed points for the dynamics
        that are stable across random initialization of the model.

  title={SalientGrads: Sparse Models for Communication Efficient and data aware Distributed Federated Training},
  author={Riyasat Ohib and Bishal Thapaliya and Pratyush Reddy and Jingyu Liu and Vince Calhoun and Sergey Plis},
  abstract={Federated learning (FL) enables training of a model leveraging  decentralized data in client sites while preserving privacy by not 
      collecting data. However, one of the significant challenges of FL is limited computation and low communication bandwidth in resource limited 
      edge client nodes. To address this several solutions have been proposed in recent times including transmitting sparse models and learning 
      dynamic masks iteratively among others. However, many of these methods rely on transmitting the model weights throughout the training process 
      as they are based and ad-hoc or random pruning criteria. In this work, we propose \technique which simplifies the process of sparse training
      by choosing a subnetwork before training based on aggregated model connection saliency scores calculated from the local client data and only
      sharing highly sparse gradients between server and clients during the training phase. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
      real world federated learning framework and report improvement in wall-clock communication time.

  abbr={TMLR},
  title={Explicit Group Sparse Projection with Applications to Deep Learning and NMF},
  author={Riyasat Ohib and Nicolas Gillis and Niccolò Dalmasso and Sameena Shah and Vamsi Potluru and Sergey Plis},
            abstract={We design a new sparse projection method for a set of vectors that guarantees a desired average sparsity level measured leveraging the popular Hoyer measure (an affine function of the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms).
            Existing approaches either project each vector individually or require the use of a regularization parameter which implicitly maps to the average $\ell_0$-measure of sparsity. Instead, in our approach we set the sparsity level for the whole set explicitly and simultaneously project a group of vectors with the sparsity level of each vector tuned automatically.
            We show that the computational complexity of our projection operator is linear in the size of the problem.
            Additionally, we propose a generalization of this projection by replacing the $\ell_1$ norm by its weighted version.
            We showcase the efficacy of our approach in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks on image datasets including CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In deep neural network pruning, the sparse models produced by our method on ResNet50 have significantly higher accuracies at corresponding sparsity values compared to existing competitors. In nonnegative matrix factorization, our approach yields competitive reconstruction errors against state-of-the-art algorithms.

@article{samin2021offline,

  title={Single-Shot Pruning for Offline Reinforcement Learning},
  author={Samin Yeasar and Riyasat Ohib and Sergey Plis and Doina Precup},
  abstract={Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex
            real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are traditionally 
            associated with better generalization capabilities, but their increased
            size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration, substantial hardware
            resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle this problem is to
            prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters. State-of-the-art
            concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform demonstrably
            well in applications where data-distributions are fixed. However, they have not
            yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close the gap between
            RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general pruning approach
            to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural networks before
            the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the network sparsity
            level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization techniques in continuous 
            control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the network weights
            pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in the majority of our
            experiments. To the best of our knowledge no prior work utilizing pruning in
            RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity. Moreover, pruning at
            initialization techniques can be easily integrated into any existing Offline-RL
            algorithms without changing the learning objective.},

  title={Grouped Sparse Projection for Deep Learning},
  author={Riyasat Ohib and Nicolas Gillis and Sergey Plis and Vamsi Potluru},
  abstract={Accumulating empirical evidence shows that very large deep learning models learn faster and achieve higher accuracy than their 
            smaller counterparts. Yet, smaller models have benefits of energy efficiency and are often easier to interpret. To simultaneously 
            get the benefits of large and small models we often encourage sparsity in the model weights of large models. For this, different 
            approaches have been proposed including weight-pruning and distillation. Unfortunately, most existing approaches do not have a 
            controllable way to request a desired value of sparsity as an interpretable parameter and get it right in a single run. In this work, 
            we design a new sparse projection method for a set of weights in order to achieve a desired average level of sparsity without additional
            hyperparameter tuning which is measured using the ratio of the l1 and l2 norms. Instead of projecting each vector of the weight matrix 
            individually, or using sparsity as a regularizer, we project all vectors together to achieve an average target sparsity, where the
            sparsity levels of the individual vectors of the weight matrix are automatically tuned. Our projection operator has the following 
            guarantees – (A) it is fast and enjoys a runtime linear in the size of the vectors; (B) the solution is unique except for a measure 
            set of zero. We utilize our projection operator to obtain the desired sparsity of deep learning models in a single run with a 
            negligible performance hit, while competing methods require sparsity hyperparameter tuning. Even with a single projection of a 
            pre-trained dense model followed by fine-tuning, we show empirical performance competitive to the state of the art. We support these 
            claims with empirical evidence on real-world datasets and on a number of architectures, comparing it to other state of the art 
            methods including DeepHoyer.},

  author={Arnob, Samin Yeasar and Ohib, Riyasat and Muhaisin, Md Muhtady and Hassan, Tanzil Bin},
  abstract={The Electric Network Frequency (ENF) is the supply frequency of power distribution networks, which can be
  captured by multimedia signals recorded near electrical activities. It normally fluctuates slightly over time from its
  nominal value of 50 Hz/60 Hz. The ENF remain consistent across the entire power grid. This has led to the emergence of multiple
  forensic application like estimating the recording location and validating the time of recording. Recently an ENF based Machine
  Learning system was proposed which infers that the region of recording can be identified using ENF signal extracted from the
  recorded multimedia signal, with the help of relevant features. As supervised learning process requires ground truth to train
  classifier for identifying future unknown data, in this work- we report Power Recording data extraction process from the
  National Grid of Bangladesh. Furthermore, we used ENF data – derived from Power Recordings, to compare grids around the
  world and found out classification accuracy of Bangladesh National Grid. ENF derivation process from Power Recording
  data and set of features, which serve as identifying characteristics for detecting the region of origin of the multimedia recordingare 
  followed from published work. We used those characteristics in a multiclass Machine Learning implementation based on
  MATLAB which is able to identify the grid of the recorded signal.},

  title={Metal nanoparticle enhanced light absorption in GaAs thin-film solar cell},
  author={Ohib, Riyasat and Arnob, Samin Yeasar and Ali, Md Sayem and Sagor, Rakibul Hasan and Amin, Md Ruhul},
  abstract={Surface plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles are of considerable importance for thin film technologies due to the significant
            electromagnetic enhancement in the vicinity of metal surface, light trapping and the ability to tune the resonant wavelength by varying the size,
            geometry and local dielectric environment of the metal nanoparticle. Metal nanoparticles have the ability for enhanced light trapping, increased
            absorption and overall rise in efficiency of solar cells. Light enhancement engineered on the vicinity of such particles can augment the 
            absorption in the absorber layer of the Photovoltaic (PV) cell. In this report, we present calculations of light absorption inside the GaAs 
            absorber layer with embedded metal nanospheres and the subsequent effects instigated by the plasmonic phenomena. The finite element simulation
            software COMSOL Multiphysics was employed for calculations of light absorption near Au, Ag, Cu and Al nanoparticles and optimization of 
            particle diameters. The results conclude that above 600 nm wavelength where the solar radiation is absorbed poorly by GaAs, the absorption 
            with the presence of nanoparticles in GaAs absorber layer can be enhanced by a factor of 2.},
