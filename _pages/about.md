I am a Graduate Student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. While I have a broad interest in learning algorithms, my current research primarily centers on the development of sparse and efficient neural networks and understanding the intricacies of their training process. I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Center for Translational Research in Neuro-imaging and Data Science ([TReNDS](https://trendscenter.org/)), a joint research center by Georgia Tech, Georgia State and Emory University under the supervision of [Dr. Vince Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Sergey Plis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nm3liowAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am primarily interested in sparsity in deep learning, model compression, efficient AI and sparse learning. Beyond the traditional efficiency benefits of sparsity, I'm drawn to its potential in yielding models that not only outperform their dense counterparts but may also exhibit enhanced robustness and other favorable attributes often overlooked in conventional sparsity research. I am also involved in the areas of federated, multi-task and multimodal learning.
